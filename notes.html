        Ultimately this sled became a kind of artifact. An object from a world or society that
        exists, but only presents itself within the bounds of this object. It’s a diving board into this world. It’s
        laying down a specific set of aesthetic rules that suggest characteristics about this world. It has its own
        laws of physics. It’s a structural failure here, on earth, at this time, but where and when does it succeed?
        Under what conditions? Does the planet have less gravity?
