            things.<br><br>

            I would prefer to discuss these topics over dinner, but this medium is infinitly more
            cost-effective.<br><br>

            <a href="finished.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">This way please ></a>

            <!--  The site has 4 main sections. To start, is a selection of ideas that I consider <a href="finished.html"
                style="text-decoration: underline;">finished</a>.
            Then comes a
            looser selection of ideas with an emphasis on <a href="development.html"
                style="text-decoration: underline;">development</a>. Following that is
            a set of <a href="notes.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">notes</a> covering
            subject matter whose range could best be described as amorphous. Last, but not least, is the siteâ€™s most
            exhilarating page: <a href="contact.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">contact</a>.</div> -->
